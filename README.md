# Network Penetration Testing Project

## Overview
This project, **"Network Penetration Testing and Vulnerability Assessment"**, was executed under the guidance of **Mr. Nishchay Gaba (Senior Faculty, Cybersecurity)** at **SURE Trust – Innovation & Entrepreneurship Hub for Educated Rural Youth (IERY)**. The goal was to evaluate the security of a specified network infrastructure using black-box testing techniques and provide a detailed vulnerability analysis and remediation roadmap.

- **Intern:** Mr. Ritik Kumar (B.Tech, CSE)
- **Duration:** September 2024 – March 2025
- **Mode:** Remote (Black-Box Testing)

---

## Objectives

- Identify vulnerabilities in network services across a defined IP range.
- Evaluate vulnerabilities using **CVSS v3** standards.
- Simulate real-world cyberattacks and validate risks.
- Provide practical, prioritized remediation strategies.
- Enhance stakeholder awareness and resilience to network threats.

---

## Methodology

The pentest followed a structured 4-phase lifecycle:
1. **Planning** – Define scope, rules of engagement.
2. **Discovery** – Scan, enumerate services, gather intelligence.
3. **Attack/Exploitation** – Confirm vulnerabilities through controlled exploitation.
4. **Reporting** – Deliver technical findings, risk analysis, and mitigation plans.

---

## Tools & Technologies Used

- **Nmap** – Network scanner for discovery and port analysis.
- **Metasploit** – Exploitation framework.
- **Nessus** – Vulnerability scanner for system and service misconfigurations.
- **Wireshark** – Network protocol analyzer for packet inspection.
- **Burp Suite** – Intercepting proxy for web-based enumeration.

## Key Findings

| Severity  | Count | Sample Vulnerabilities |
|-----------|-------|------------------------|
| Critical  | 6     | BlueKeep (RDP), Samba RCE, OpenSSH PKCS#11, HTTP login over plain text |
| High      | 9     | Anonymous file upload, Admin page exposure, VSFTPD DoS |
| Medium    | 6     | XSS in blog, MySQL privilege escalation, Apache partial request DoS |
| Low       | 2     | Anonymous FTP, OpenSSH authentication confusion |

---

## Recommendations

- **Patch & Upgrade** outdated software (OpenSSH, Samba, Exim, etc.).
- **Disable unnecessary services** (FTP, SNMPv1, unsecured RDP).
- **Enforce encryption** (HTTPS, SFTP, SNMPv3).
- **Use IDS/IPS** for real-time threat detection.
- **Implement strict access control** (IP whitelisting, firewalls, strong auth).
- **Regular vulnerability assessments** and monitoring.

---

## Deliverables

- Detailed Vulnerability Report
- CVSS Risk Matrix
- Exploit Demonstrations & PoC
- Remediation Plan
- GitHub Repository & Architecture Overview
- Stakeholder Presentation

---

## Learning Outcomes

- Gained hands-on experience in real-world VAPT.
- Deep understanding of network-based vulnerabilities.
- Practical application of OWASP and CVE frameworks.
- Developed secure configurations and best practices.

---

## Future Scope

- Incorporate white-box testing and config# Network Penetration Testing Project
